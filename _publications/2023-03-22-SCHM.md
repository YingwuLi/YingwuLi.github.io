# Abstract
In this work, the strain measurement accuracy of single-mode fibre (SMF) under thermal and vibration loads is investigated by strain-frequency shift coefficient analyses. This research allows for the application of SMF sensors for structural health monitoring in real operational conditions. The strain measurement accuracy under combined static and thermal load is investigated experimentally, which demonstrated that temperature fluctuations induce non-negligible errors in the strain measurement, even with temperature compensation applied. The temperature fluctuation range which can induce measurement errors is quantified as less than −20°C or higher than 55°C. In addition, a fatigue experiment is conducted to investigate the measurement accuracy under low-frequency vibration load. The results of the fatigue experiment demonstrate that the vibrations mainly increase the ratio of null values in strain measurements. Findings from experiments can be applied to enhance structural health monitoring accuracy and reduce false positives. This study has important implications for the service application of distributed optical fibre sensing for composite structure health monitoring.
