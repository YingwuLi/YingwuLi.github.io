Distributed intelligent sensing technologies involve the use of distributed sensor systems to continuously acquire, process, and analyze information about structures or environments. Fiber optic sensors are widely applied due to their high sensitivity, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and capability for long-distance deployment, enabling measurements of strain, temperature, and vibration. Shape reconstruction techniques utilize sensor data to determine complex structural deformations, providing accurate structural state awareness. Integrated with structural health monitoring (SHM), these technologies allow continuous monitoring of bridges, aircraft, wind turbine blades, and other engineering structures to detect damage or anomalies early, improving safety and reliability. With advances in intelligent algorithms and data fusion, distributed intelligent sensing is driving structures toward self-awareness, adaptability, and autonomous maintenance.
