Digital Twin and Artificial Intelligence represent a powerful integration of physical systems with advanced computational models. Digital twins create virtual replicas of physical assets, processes, or systems, enabling real-time monitoring, simulation, and optimization throughout their lifecycle. When combined with AI, these twins can not only reflect the current state of a system but also predict future behavior, detect anomalies, and support decision-making. This research direction has broad applications in aerospace, energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure, driving the development of smarter, more reliable, and sustainable engineering systems.
